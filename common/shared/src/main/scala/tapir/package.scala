/** Inlined to simplify my life. This package was added to state this comment. Currently (at the time this was written),
  * tapir-http4s-client does not have a Scala.js build. I inlined the library to be able to use it on the `frontend`
  * code. I stripped away any fs2 mention, due to it encumbering the size of the generated .js files.
  *
  * Shamelessly / Respectfully taken and altered from
